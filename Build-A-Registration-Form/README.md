This project is a part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification 🏆 and focuses on building a functional, accessible, and responsive registration form ✍️. Throughout the development process, I applied HTML to structure the form with various input types 📝, including text fields, radio buttons ⚪️⚫️, a file input for profile picture uploads 📸, a dropdown for selecting how users heard about the site 📥, and a text area for a short bio ✨. I also incorporated HTML attributes like required, pattern, and min/max to ensure proper data validation ✅, enhancing the user experience. On the styling side, CSS was used to create a clean and modern design 💻 that is fully responsive, making the form adaptable across different devices 📱💻. This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of form creation, validation, and responsive design principles, essential skills for any web developer 🚀.
